This project aims at developing a user-friendly interface to control a robotic arm using the gesture recognition. This package will allow a user to just stand in front of the camera and move his hands. The robotic arm will try to mimic the motion of the user's hand. It allows fluid movements of robotic arm possible which are not easy to perform in real-time using even high-end controller.
